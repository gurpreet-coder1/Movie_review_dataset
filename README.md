# Movie_review_dataset
In this dataset we are finding the accuracy on the movie reviews by applying nltk naivebayes and sklearn classifier.
Firstly we lemmatized the data.
Then made it in the form of dictionary in which each list has the document words and its category.
The data is converted in the form in which it is accepted by the nltk classifier.
